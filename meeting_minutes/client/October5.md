##Agenda of meeting
To finalize the implementations in DataPub for R1

##Minutes

###Discussion:
1. The analytics tool clicky to be stopped to be used and piwik will be used now
2. Certain doubts regarding datapub aspects such as virality and dynamic filters cleared
3. Decided that piwik will be used to track the blog page managed by `digitant.co`.
4. The datapub statistics analysis will be done on the `info.digitant.co/blog` 
5. Finalised that controller in angular js would receive json objects in a server side as php and rendered with JS.

####Conclusion: 
Finalised what is needed for R1 by the client.

####Other points:
Problems to tackle: The objects should not be added as a list but should be accessed directly from the database to avoid read/write errors and overhead to the file when many, say 20 + users visit the website at the same time.

###Action points:
1. Track the blog with piwik
2. Render the objects through graphs on datapub
