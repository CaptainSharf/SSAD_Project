##Minutes

###Discussion:
Clicky as an alternative to google analytics was suggested as it provides real time data and is easier to use. We also decided to create the website using php instead of using django or ruby on rails. The client gave us access to their website so we could test the working of clicky and learn how to manipulate the output of clicky and use it.

####Conclusion: 
	Clicky can serve a better purpose to do all of the analytics needs.
####Other points:

###Action points:
Learn php,learn clicky(gui and api) ,create a smallscale website and track activity using clicky
